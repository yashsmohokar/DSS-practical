Data Science & Statistics Practice (DSS-practical)

This repository hosts my hands-on practice work in Data Science and Statistics, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to build a solid foundation for data-driven analysis and machine-learning workflows.

📚 What’s Included

Creating and manipulating arrays (NumPy)

Building DataFrames and performing data-acquisition tasks (Pandas)

Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode

Handling missing values and cleaning data

Data visualization techniques

Simple linear regression

Machine-learning algorithms: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM / SVC), Random Forests, Decision Trees

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Workflow from data ingestion → feature engineering → model training


🎯 Purpose

This repository serves to:

Strengthen my analytical and programming skills in Python for data science

Build a practical understanding of statistical methods and machine-learning algorithms

Demonstrate a workflow for solving real-world data problems


🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Version control via Git & GitHub
